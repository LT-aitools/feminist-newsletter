Technical PRD - Women's Rights Newsletter Automation
Python + Google Cloud Functions Implementation (PRODUCTION)

Project Overview
Successfully migrated and enhanced the existing Google Apps Script newsletter automation to a Python-based Google Cloud Functions solution that handles MailChimp redirects and extracts accurate event times from invitation materials using Google Cloud Vision API.

Architecture Overview
Gmail API → Cloud Function → [MailChimp Redirect Resolution] → [OCR Processing] → Calendar API
    ↓
Cloud Scheduler (Weekly Trigger) → Cloud Function → Cloud Vision API → Google Calendar

Core Function Specifications (PRODUCTION)
1. Main Cloud Function (main.py)
✅ newsletter_processor(request): Main Cloud Function entry point
✅ Triggered weekly by Cloud Scheduler
✅ Processes recent emails from both senders
✅ Returns processing summary with statistics

2. Time Extraction (time_extractor.py)
✅ extract_time_from_invitation_link(url: str): Process invitation links
✅ extract_time_from_image(image_url: str): Extract times from images using Vision API
✅ _parse_hebrew_time(text: str): Parse Hebrew time formats

3. Service Account Authentication (service_account_auth.py)
✅ ServiceAccountAuth: Service account authentication class
✅ authenticate_gmail(): Gmail API authentication
✅ authenticate_calendar(): Calendar API authentication
✅ authenticate_vision(): Vision API authentication

4. Event Processing (newsletter_processor.py)
✅ process_newsletter_email(email_content: str): Extract event information
✅ _enhance_event_with_time(event: EventData): Extract accurate time from invitation links
✅ check_for_duplicate_event(): Duplicate detection
✅ create_calendar_event(): Calendar event creation

Time Extraction Logic (PRODUCTION)
Hebrew Time Pattern Matching
TIME_PATTERNS = [
    r'(\d{1,2}):(\d{2})\s*-\s*(\d{1,2}):(\d{2})',  # 19:00-21:00
    r'(\d{1,2})\s*:\s*(\d{2})\s*-\s*(\d{1,2})\s*:\s*(\d{2})',  # 19 : 00 - 21 : 00
    r'מ(\d{1,2}):(\d{2})\s*עד\s*(\d{1,2}):(\d{2})',  # Hebrew format
    r'(\d{1,2}):(\d{2})',  # Single time
]
