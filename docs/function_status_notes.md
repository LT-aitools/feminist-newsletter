## Important Notes for Future Checks

### When Checking Function Status:
1. **Look for status code: 200** - This indicates successful completion
2. **Ignore old Gmail API errors** - These were resolved
3. **Service account warnings are normal** - Function still works
4. **Focus on recent execution logs** - Not historical errors

### Commands to Check Status:
```bash
# Check recent function logs
gcloud functions logs read newsletter-processor --region=us-central1 --limit=20

# Check scheduler status
gcloud scheduler jobs describe newsletter-processor-schedule --location=us-central1

# Check function list
gcloud functions list --filter="name:newsletter"
```

### Key Indicators of Success:
- ✅ "Function execution took X ms, finished with status code: 200"
- ✅ "Calendar API service created successfully"
- ✅ No critical errors in recent logs
- ✅ Scheduler showing recent "lastAttemptTime"

### What NOT to Worry About:
- Service account showing as "default" in logs
- Warnings about service account configuration
