# Cursor Rules for Feminist Newsletter Project

## Function Status Analysis
When analyzing the newsletter processor function status or logs:
1. **ALWAYS check `docs/function_status_notes.md` first** for current status and common misconceptions
2. **Focus on status code: 200** as the primary success indicator
3. **Ignore old Gmail API errors** - these were resolved and are not current issues
4. **Service account warnings are normal** - function still works correctly
5. **Look at recent execution logs**, not historical errors

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Don't panic about service account showing as "default" in logs
- Don't confuse old Gmail API "Precondition check failed" errors with current status
- Don't assume warnings indicate failure - check if function completed with status 200
- Don't forget that 1st gen Cloud Functions have service account limitations

## Key Commands for Status Checks
```bash
# Check recent function logs
gcloud functions logs read newsletter-processor --region=us-central1 --limit=20

# Check scheduler status  
gcloud scheduler jobs describe newsletter-processor-schedule --location=us-central1

# Check function list
gcloud functions list --filter="name:newsletter"
```

## Project Context
- Function: `newsletter-processor` in `us-central1`
- Scheduler: `newsletter-processor-schedule` 
- Project: `womens-rights-calendar`
- Schedule: 7 PM Israel time on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday
- Status: ACTIVE and working correctly as of July 16, 2025

## Documentation Priority
When troubleshooting or analyzing function behavior:
1. Check `docs/function_status_notes.md` for current status
2. Check `docs/technical_prd.md` for technical requirements
3. Check `docs/existing_code.md` for implementation details
4. Update documentation when status changes
